***************************************************
This is a basic explanation of the GMSSimpleMIDI functions.

GMSSimpleMIDI uses the RtMIDI library to allow Gamemaker Studio games to send and receive MIDI messages.
This could be used to make sequencers or arpeggiators in GMS, or use MIDI controllers as input devices
for games made with GMS. Any kind of message can be received, including sysex and NRPN, and any kind 
of message, exluding sysex, can be sent.
