TODO
- wider DAC list
- new optimization for seamless transitions using bezier curve, and curve check every point
- better default optimization settings
- fix small gap at start or end of some segments. Especially noticeable in fonts etc.
- crash on exit IDN on mac/linux in dacwrapper. See error below*
- ability to select multiple items in editor by dragging mouse
- update windows/linux dacwrapper to use netmask on IDN broadcast.
- use ds_list pooling to improve reliability due to reused index GM shenanigans 
- record mac address for license, for better piracy detection
- fix ctrl+key shortcuts in linux
- included set of ILDA files / beams 
- fix when element outside canvas, frame is exported to ild with 0 points. (fixed?)
- rearranging of tiles in Live Mode.
- fix opening web on linux (not working on my kubuntu with firefox)
- add backup saving to background, asking to restore if program didn't shut down correctly
- text turns gray when in rainbow color tool
- fix crash if scanning for lasercubes when they are already in use by another program like laseros (Not reproducible?)
- update web
- fix crash on app close on macos after having used IDN dac
- add possibility for assigning different projectors to live modes files.
- add possibility to show cursor in editor when laser is on.
- add midi cc and nrpn
- ability to easily add shaking effect to multiple objects on timeline mode. Envelope?
- improve resizing, rotation. Add resizing boxes to all sides and corners for free control (or just make anchor snap to sides/corners)
- implement new modulo method used in anirep, in element creation cycles like dots and blanking
- zoom in editor mode timeline
- undo stretching maxframes in editor mode
- compress buffers when saving in live mode and editor mode
- save settings like color and parameters to igf file and timeline object
- experiment with better scaling (higher res sprites?)
- make large preview work with dpi scaling > 1
- automatic playback of show when opening software, for headless computer setup. 
- fix mismatch between mouse and cursor when window is too narrow.
- add dmx
- mac dialogs keep keyboard buttons pressed, io_reset() doesn't work
- fix first point in live mode not rotating in preview when applying rotation slider (works in laser output)
- midi output on timeline, to trigger events in f.ex the radiator
- arbitrary animation easing function
- midi input for live mode trigger etc.
- reapply combine shapes
- split objects in editor mode
- add back file registering when yyg fixes file parameter opening
- add default setting profiles into older settings file retroactively if they don't exist
- investigate and fix problem of dac (laserdock?) falling out and having to rescan. Automatic rescan on failure?
- add custom anchor to timeline mode rotation envelope
- BPM sync indicator/quantization in all modes
- pause individual files in live
- zoom in editor mode canvas
- more simulation settings (more projectors per layer, projector angle, fov etc)
- benchmark frame buffers, better to align to 4?
- set fixed scanrate instead of fps when optimization off
- fix 1 point dots not showing, see line 52 in refresh_surfaces
- color offset and dwell etc based on time instead of points
- double check and fix maxpoints_static calculation
- remember ilda font on restart
- motion controller
- AUTOMATIC live mode
- audio_loudness_previous_frame
- shaking stuff (email 2017-11-18)
- Support for other glyphs in the text tool
