message = "This is the timeline window. It lets you arrange your files on a timeline with layers to create long and complex shows. You can also load music to synchronize the show to.\nTo start, you can add laser files by first clicking on a layer in the timeline to mark a position, then loading a file or importing what you have drawn in the editor mode using the buttons in the bottom right (or the 'File' menu on top). You can also try out a free demo show by choosing 'Load demo show' in the File menu.  \n\nNB: The timeline mode is only available in the paid version of the program.\n";
